# DeepOIS: Gyroscope-guided deep optical image stabilizer compensation
## How to generate GT labels

We introduce Essential-Mixtures Model to calculate GT labels, which is effective. However, it requires non-trivial computation resources and is not stable. So we here provide an alternative method called [Homography Mixtures](https://github.com/lhaippp/Homography-Mixtures).
